**This file will help to explain the layout necessary for the csv 
**to be processed by the checksum generator program.
*
*COLUMN/FIELD SPECIFICS*
-The program is designed to take in a csv file with any amount of 
-fields (columns), as long as the path variable field is in the 
-second column. If the path variable is not in the second column, the 
-program will encounter a critical error when generating checksums, 
-display an error message and close.
*
*HEADERS*
-The program will take in the first row of the csv file as headers
-for the output csv. 
-It cannot distinguish between a header and the first row of input, 
-so please be sure to input headers into your csv before processing the file.
*
*HOW DATA IS INPUT/OUTPUT*
-With each file, the checksum will be created and appended to the 
-end of the row, then printed into a new csv. Each row will contain 
-any previous information in the file with this checksum added as a new field.
